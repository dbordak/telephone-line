#+Title: Configuration

* Segment overview

Themes are defined by customizing the ~telephone-line-lhs~ and
~telephone-line-rhs~ variables, for the left and right parts of the
mode-line, respectively.

The configuration format for both is an alist containing pairs of the form

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(COLOR-SYMBOL . (LIST OF SUBSEGMENT FUNCTIONS))
#+end_src

Each one of these pairs defines a "supersegment" -- a bunch of
subsegments using the same face. In the screenshots, you can see the
minor modes and buffer information are in the same color, though they
aren't the same segment (i.e. ~FlyC- ivy U:--- *scratch*~ consists
of the subsegments ~FlyC- ivy~ and ~U:--- *scratch*~). These
subsegments are separated by secondary separators, such as the thin
powerline symbol (it looks like ~>~, but larger).

** Color Symbols

The ~Color Symbol~ determines what face is used for the supersegment.
By default, the choices are:

#+begin_example
    nil:    mode-line                                  or mode-line-inactive
    accent: telephone-line-accent-active               or telephone-line-accent-inactive
    evil:   telephone-line-evil-{insert, normal, etc.} or mode-line-inactive
#+end_example

You can add more by customizing ~telephone-line-faces~.

Each of these symbols also has a subseparator color associated with
it, which you can configure by changing
~telephone-line-subseparator-faces~. By default, ~nil~ uses ~accent~'s
background color as its subseparator color, and the others use
~nil~'s. If you ever map a color symbol to itself, this will cause the
subseparator to have the same foreground as the rest of the text in
that segment.

** Diagram

This shows how a config maps to the mode-line. Important to note is
how the accent supersegment has three subsegments, but only one is
displayed (and there are no subseparators). This is because
subsegments are dynamic. When a subsegment has no information to
display, it doesn't need a subseparator (in contrast, primary
separators are _always_ displayed).

** Example Configuration

The screenshots above aren't the default configuration; it's all
defined in my dotfiles.

Here's the relevant section:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq telephone-line-lhs
        '((evil   . (telephone-line-evil-tag-segment))
          (accent . (telephone-line-vc-segment
                     telephone-line-erc-modified-channels-segment
                     telephone-line-process-segment))
          (nil    . (telephone-line-minor-mode-segment
                     telephone-line-buffer-segment))))
(setq telephone-line-rhs
        '((nil    . (telephone-line-misc-info-segment))
          (accent . (telephone-line-major-mode-segment))
          (evil   . (telephone-line-airline-position-segment))))

(telephone-line-mode t)
#+end_src

...That's it. That's essentially all there is to creating a theme.
Make sure you initialize it after the configuration, though, or
else some buffers won't have it enabled.

Now, before you go copy-pasting the above config, it's important to
know that it requires both evil and erc. If you're not using evil,
though, the defaults should be fine.

* Creating New Segments

There are a bunch of different ~defsegment~ functions for creating
your own segments, but when in doubt, try ~defsegment*~. This is
kinda... Not well defined at the moment, but I'll try to clear it up.

Here's an example of a static segment:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(telephone-line-defsegment my-meme-segment ()
  "Meme")
#+end_src

This segment can now be added as described above. It will match the
color of the supersegment, and staticly display "Meme".

The ~defsegment~ functions can also take lists of strings.

* Creating New Separators

I mentioned before that the separators are defined in terms of two
functions. Here's the way that works:

Imagine the cross-section of the mode-line as a number line, ranging
from -height/2 to +height/2. The first function is applied across this
number line to get the shape of the separator. Here's the most famous
separator, defined as 2*abs(x).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    -4 |       *
    -3 |     *
    -2 |   *
    -1 | *
     0 +
     1 | *
     2 |   *
     3 |     *
     4 |       *
#+END_EXAMPLE

There you go: a separator. However, we still need another piece.
That second function I mentioned determines the fill -- the difference
between a solid separator and a hollow one.

This isn't the sort of function I'd expect to get much customization
out of, but there are 3 included ones. The first makes a hollow
separator, which looks more-or-less like the ASCII art above. The
second provides a fill:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    -4 |       *
    -3 |     *--
    -2 |   *----
    -1 | *------
     0 +--------
     1 | *------
     2 |   *----
     3 |     *--
     4 |       *
#+END_EXAMPLE

The third one is a special thing that ignores the first function
entirely and just produces the same output regardless of the input.
It's used to make the gradient separator.

Choice of separator can be customized as well, by changing the values
of =telephone-line-{primary,secondary}-{left,right}-separator=. This
should be a function which accepts two faces or colors (if provided
faces, the built-in separators use the background field) and returns a
propertized image. The separators can be defined independently of one
another -- feel free to use a nominally left separator for your rhs,
or mix two different types of separators.

** Unicode Separators

The function for defining separators takes an optional argument for a
character to display when in a terminal. For the abs separator, this
is set to the usual Powerline symbol.

* Separator Types

You probably also noticed from the screenshots that there are in fact
two types of separator on either side of the mode-line. The way this
works involves the lhs/rhs alists.

Basically, lists of segment functions associated to a color symbol are
rendered into a 'supersegment'. Supersegments are separated by primary
separators. Internally, non-nil segment-functions are rendered into
'subsegments'. Subsegments are separated by secondary separators.

Primary separators are static -- the customization I showed will
always produce 4 primary separators. Secondaries depend upon the
subsegments state, so there could be anywhere from 0-3 in my config.

* Package structure

- telephone-line.el: Stuff for setting up the mode-line
- telephone-line-separators.el: Separator definitions
- telephone-line-segments.el: Segment definitions
- telephone-line-utils.el: Functions strictly for defining new
  Separators and Segments

If you just want the separators, you can just require that. It does
depend upon utils, however.
